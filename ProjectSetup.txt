2. To configure HTTPS, run the following commands in a CMD:  
- choco install mkcert  
- mkcert -install  
- mkcert -cert-file cert.pem -key-file key.pem localhost (They will be created in System 32 and need to be moved to the local repository).  

3. For the back-end solution, within VS 2022:  
In the secrets.json file, configure:  
- SQL Server connection string. It has the following format:  

"CarLoungeDb": ""  

- VinDecoder API settings as a JSON of the VINDecoderService class type. It should have the following format:  

"MailSettings": {  
    "Server": "send.smtp.mailtrap.io",  
    "Port": 587,  
    "SenderName": "invoice@carlounge.org",  
    "SenderEmail": "invoice@carlounge.org",  
    "UserName": "api",

    "ApiToken": "apiTokenHere",  
    "ApiBaseUrl": "https://send.api.mailtrap.io/api/"

Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> run the command update-database.  

4. In a terminal within VS Code, install the required packages using the following commands:  
- nvm use 12.22.12  
- npm install  

5. For the front-end solution, you need to create the .env file, which should contain:  

https=true  
SSL_CRT_FILE=E:\RepoLicenta\cert.pem  
SSL_KEY_FILE=E:\RepoLicenta\key.pem  
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://localhost:44337
